# G2M Case Study
Welcome to the G2M Case Study project in my Data Glacier internship repository! 
This project involves analysing customer data for multiple cab companies and providing insights into improving their services.

# Project Description
**The project is divided into three phases:**

**Data Exploration and Cleaning:** In this phase, I explore and clean the provided customer and sales data to ensure that it is ready for analysis. 
This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and dealing with outliers.

**Data Analysis:** In this phase, I perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the customer behavior and sales trends. 
This includes identifying key customer segments, analysing sales patterns, and exploring relationships between different variables.

**Recommendations:** In this phase, I provide recommendations to the cab companies based on the insights gained in the previous phases. 
These recommendations aim to increase sales and customer retention by targeting specific customer segments and optimising marketing and sales strategies.

# Tools and Technologies
The project is implemented using Python and several data science and machine learning libraries, including:

Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
Scikit-Learn for machine learning
